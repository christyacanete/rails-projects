# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end
   
# Create sample users
2.times do |n|
  name = "User #{n+1}"
  email = "user#{n+1}@example.com"
  password = "password"
  User.create!(name: name, email: email, password: password)
end

# Generate microposts for a subset of users
users = User.order(:created_at).take(6)
50.times do
  content = Faker::Lorem.sentence(word_count: 5)
  users.each { |user| user.microposts.create!(content: content) }
end
